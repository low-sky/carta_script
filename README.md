carta_script
============

Sample Scripts for CARTA development.  These are pseudocode mockups of some possiblities.

*  `CartaSample.py` is a first attempt with some confused semantics.
*  `CartaSample2.py` is a second attempt with more clear approach to the image object method for controlling layers.
*  `aplpy_integration.py` some ideas about how to connect to `aplpy` to handle connection figure.
